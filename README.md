USRP-2020
Simple Repo of programs created to evaluate the use of a convolutional neural network to predicted the cosmological and astrophysical parameters of a simulated universe 
given an image of a specified field of a galaxy formed in that universe. SingleParamML.py takes 1 input image to predict the parameters and stores redicted and actual 
values of the parameters in several texfiles, which can be graphed by Graph_Loss_Pred.py. In future will attempt to create multi-parameter network for more accurate 
predictions of parameters.
